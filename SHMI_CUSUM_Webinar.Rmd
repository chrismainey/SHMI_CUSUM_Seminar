## Standardised Mortlaty Ratios (SMRs)

+ Difference in case-mix between hospitals hinder mortality comparisons
 
 + Patient population / demographics
 + Referral patterns / service provision

--

+ Indirectly-standardised, using regression models
 + Individual Probability of death calculated
$$SMR = \frac{\Sigma{(\text{Number of Observed deaths})}}{\Sigma{(\text{Predicted Probability of death})}}$$

--

### Common SMRs:

+ __SHMI:__ Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator, NHS official indicaotr for death in hospitals of within 30-days
+ __HSMR__: Hospital Standardised Mortlaity Ratio, Dr Foster-based indicator of ~80% in-hospital deaths

---

# SHMI development

___Number of criticisms remain:___
+ Model quality was poor in certain groups
+ No deprivation, ethnicity, or palliative information
+ Apparent South-East bias
+ Distinct seasonal patterns
+ Out-of-date
+ Inconsistent across large / intergrated providers

--

___NHS Digital Changes:___
+ Regrouped: hodgkins/non-hidgkins lymphoma, birth and obs/meternity.
+ Added Birth-weight predictor to neonatal groups
+ Seasonality now included as admission month
+ Publication now monthly(mostly...)
+ Site-level now published*

---

# Site-level SHMI

Many of you may have filled in an NHS Digital servey about site in recent weeks.
Site is inconsistently recorded, coded and submitted to HES.

<br><br>

__NHSD techniques developed:__
+ Using CQC registered sites/providers
+ Merging with ODS data and HES
+ USing their own remapping
+ Manual correction likely in subsequent publications

--

<br><br>
__HED using look-up tables supplied by NHSD, and applying remapping to SITETRET.__


---

# HED module changes

+ Renaming (from this month)

--

+ All model parameters now provided:
 
 + NHSD added more predicotrs, but not in co-ordination with DARS team
 + NHSD did not provide other predictors to subscribers
 + Fit SHMI from NHSD coefficients, calcualte in/out hospital and palliative models

--

+ 'Monthly' SHMI

 + Subject to Type-2 opt-outs, but has patient details
 + Fitted using correct model from NHS, but numbers may differ
 + HES sites not mapped like SHMI, manual remapping

---

# Module changes

.pull-left[
![](./man/figures/SHMI_button.png)
]

.pull-right[
<br>
+ In portal , little has changed for user, mostly in underlying system
<br>
+ Additional drop-down menu on Funnel Plot (Random Effects Model)
<br>
+ Adjusts aggreagation level and recalculates 
<br>
+ Censoring and Overdispersion issues in NHSD method

]

---
# Outstandaing Issues

### Site-level mapping

+ This is inconsistent and inaccessible for other organisations.  
+ In our view, it is not fit for analysis, but we have provided it as NHSD have.

### Overdispersion 

Overdispersion (more variation than we expect in our data from theory alone) is present in SHMI.  It is adjusted for in the random-effects funnel plot by inflating the limits by the overdispersion factor.
+ OD is usually worse in smaller unit
+ Site and diangostic grouping increase OD
+ NHS censor before calcualting OD, underestimating it
+ HED applies before censoring, and we have submitted this to NHSD
---

# Summary

SHMI has moved to monthly publication, with improved division of diagnsotic groups and additions of birth-weight and seasonality predictors.  This has improved the quality of SHMI.

Reporting at site and dignaostics group level is not yet sound due to combination of censoring and overdispersion adjustments.

HED is reporting data as provided by NHS Digital, using their methods and site-lookup tables. We regularly are im regular contact with NHSD about SHMI developments and will keep up with any changes.

The only noticable chagne for users is the ability to select site or diangostic grouping in the random-effects funnel plot.

# SHMI Questions

---

# CUSUM

+ SMRs are usually compared in a 'cross-sectional' manner: a snapshot at point in time/.
+ Question is are we higher or lower than expected?

### What if I want to compare over time?

+ We can't use monthly relatie risk figures, as it's the wrong comparison.

+ We can use control charts to monitor change over time.

+ Risk-adjustment in SMRs makes them more complicated
 + i.e. ___don't use and XmR (#plothedots) chart!___

+ Risk-adjusted __CU__mulative _SUM_ log-likelihood ratio test charts can be used

+ Sequential probaility test, usually to checking if rate is twice the england rate.
